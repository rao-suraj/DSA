For a 32-bit float:
Positive Range: Approximately 1.2E-38 to 3.4E+38.
Negative Range: Approximately -3.4E+38 to -1.2E-38.
Precision: About 7 decimal digits of precision.

Detailed Structure of float
A float is stored using 32 bits, and those bits are divided into three parts based on the IEEE 754 standard:

Sign bit: 1 bit (determines whether the number is positive or negative).
Exponent: 8 bits (used to represent the scale of the number, i.e., powers of 2).
Mantissa (fraction): 23 bits (used to represent the significant digits).

WE DONT HAVE UNSIGNED FLOAT AND ALSO DOUBLE.

3. Range of a double
The range of a signed double can be broken down into positive and negative numbers, as follows:

For a 64-bit double:
Positive Range:

Smallest positive double: approximately 5.0 × 10^(-324).
Largest positive double: approximately 1.7 × 10^(308).
Negative Range:

Smallest negative double: approximately -5.0 × 10^(-324).
Largest negative double: approximately -1.7 × 10^(308).
Precision: Around 15-16 decimal digits, meaning it can accurately store numbers with that many significant digits before rounding errors occur.
